This set focuses on the practical, hands-on skills required to analyze captured network traffic for security auditing and incident response.

| No. | Question | Tool/Concept | Answer (Ethical Hacker Context) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1** | What is the fundamental difference between a **Capture Filter** and a **Display Filter**? | Wireshark/Tools | **Capture Filters (BPF)** restrict which packets are saved to the file, reducing file size. **Display Filters** only restrict what you see *after* all packets have been saved. |
| **Q2** | Which protocol is essential to sniff when performing a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack on a local segment, and why? | ARP | **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**. MITM requires injecting false ARP replies to redirect traffic, making ARP poisoning the key protocol to monitor for successful attack confirmation. |
| **Q3** | How would you use a BPF syntax filter to capture only traffic for the Telnet protocol? | Tools | `tcp port 23` |
| **Q4** | What is the security implication of seeing a large number of **ICMP Echo Reply** messages in a trace? | ICMP/Recon | It indicates a successful **ping sweep** (network discovery), confirming active hosts on the network segment for an attacker. |
| **Q5** | What does the Wireshark column entry **"\[PSH, ACK\]"** usually indicate in a TCP stream? | TCP | It signifies that the sender is pushing buffered data immediately to the application layer and acknowledging previously received data. |
| **Q6** | How can a hacker use the **TTL (Time to Live)** value in captured packets for reconnaissance? | IP/Recon | By observing the initial TTL (using a simple ping), they can often **fingerprint the target's operating system** (e.g., Windows typically starts higher than Linux/Unix). |
| **Q7** | Describe the key evidence for a **DNS Cache Poisoning** attempt in a packet capture. | DNS/Security | Look for unexpected or unauthorized **DNS response packets** from a non-authoritative server, providing a false IP address for a known domain. |
| **Q8** | What does a high rate of **TCP Retransmission** packets suggest? | TCP/Performance | Network instability, congestion, or **link errors** (such as duplex mismatch) that are causing lost packets and requiring the sending host to re-send data. |
| **Q9** | How do you filter for HTTP POST requests containing potential login credentials? | HTTP/Tools | `http.request.method == "POST"` |
| **Q10** | What is the significance of the **RST (Reset) flag** in an unexpected sequence (e.g., not preceded by a FIN)? | TCP/Security | It often indicates a **hard connection termination**, which can signal a port scan finding a closed port or an active defense mechanism (IPS/firewall) dropping a session. |
| **Q11** | Explain the function of the **EtherType** field in a captured Ethernet frame. | Layer 2 | It identifies the **protocol encapsulated** in the frame's payload (e.g., $0x0800$ for IPv4, $0x0806$ for ARP). |
| **Q12** | How do you extract an unencrypted file (e.g., a JPEG) transferred over HTTP from a .pcap file? | Tools/HTTP | Use Wireshark's **"File -> Export Objects -> HTTP"** feature, which reassembles the file stream for saving. |
| **Q13** | What pattern of packets defines a successful **TCP SYN Scan** (Stealth Scan)? | TCP/Security | **SYN** packet sent -> **SYN-ACK** received (port open) -> **RST** sent by the scanner (to prevent full connection logging). |
| **Q14** | How would you calculate the **Round Trip Time (RTT)** for a connection from a packet trace? | Analysis | Measure the time delta between the client's initial **SYN** packet and the server's **SYN-ACK** response packet. |
| **Q15** | What is the purpose of the **"Follow UDP Stream"** feature in packet analysis? | UDP/Tools | While UDP is connectionless, this feature groups together all UDP packets between the same source and destination port pair for easier viewing and analysis. |
| **Q16** | What is a **Malformed Packet**, and what might cause it? | General/Security | A packet that does not adhere to the structure defined by its protocol specification. It can be caused by network hardware error or a **malicious attempt** to exploit parsing bugs in a target system (fuzzing). |
| **Q17** | How can you identify a potential **MAC Flooding** attack through packet analysis? | Layer 2/Security | By capturing on a mirrored port, look for an **unusually high number of unique source MAC addresses** originating from a single switch port in a short time frame. |
| **Q18** | What is the most common Wireshark filter to detect a **Smurf Attack**? | ICMP/DoS | Look for a high volume of **ICMP Echo Requests** with a **spoofed source IP** and a broadcast destination IP. |
| **Q19** | When analyzing IPv6, what is the equivalent message you would look for instead of an ARP request? | ICMPv6 | **Neighbor Solicitation** (part of ICMPv6), used to resolve a Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address. |
| **Q20** | How do you deal with a trace that is too large to open or analyze efficiently? | Tools | Use a command-line tool like **`editcap`** or **`tshark`** to split the file into smaller chunks, or apply a **capture filter** when re-capturing. |
| **Q21** | What does a stream of **TCP Zero Window** packets indicate? | TCP/Flow Control | It means the receiving host has its **receive buffer full** and cannot accept any more data until it processes the current queue. This is a normal flow control mechanism, but if persistent, indicates a bottleneck. |
| **Q22** | How can you confirm that traffic is **IPsec protected**? | IPsec | Look for packets using **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)** or **AH (Authentication Header)** protocols (IP protocol numbers 50 and 51, respectively). |
| **Q23** | What is the primary use of the **Statistics -> Conversations** menu in Wireshark for incident response? | Tools/Forensics | It quickly shows the **top talkers** and the **volume of data** exchanged between pairs of hosts (endpoints), identifying unusual or large data transfers. |
| **Q24** | How do you filter a pcap to find attempts to connect to an LDAP server? | Application | `tcp.port == 389` (or `tcp.port == 636` for LDAPS). |
| **Q25** | What is the danger of running a packet analyzer with the **root/administrator** account? | Security | It is a security risk if the application itself contains a vulnerability, as an exploit would gain elevated privileges. It is best practice to run with the least necessary privileges. |
| **Q26** | How can a hacker use packet analysis to discover a **VLAN Hopping** attack? | Layer 2/Security | Look for frames that are **Double-Tagged (802.1Q)** with unexpected VLAN IDs, indicating an attempt to bypass native VLAN security. |
| **Q27** | What information can be gathered from inspecting the **DHCP Request** packets in a trace? | DHCP/Recon | The requesting host's **MAC address**, its desired **hostname**, and potentially the **vendor class identifier** (OS/device type). |
| **Q28** | Describe what a **"Bad Checksum"** flag in a captured packet usually means. | IP/General | It means the packet was likely **corrupted** during transmission. However, if the checksum is invalid only on the sniffing host (and not on the wire), it may be due to the NIC's **checksum offloading** feature. |
| **Q29** | How would you filter for all traffic destined for a private network range (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16)? | Tools | `ip.dst == 192.168.0.0/16` or `net 192.168.0.0/16`. |
| **Q30** | What is the primary challenge when analyzing an **encrypted tunnel** (e.g., SSH, HTTPS, IPsec)? | Security | Without the session keys or the server's private key, the **payload remains unusable ciphertext**. You can only analyze the unencrypted headers (IP, Port, size, timing) for behavioral analysis. |
| **Q31** | When analyzing encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS), what unencrypted information can still be gathered from the **TLS Handshake**? | TLS/Analysis | The **Server Name Indication (SNI)** (the domain name the client is requesting), the **TLS version** being used, the **Ciphersuite** negotiated, and the **server's IP address** and **certificate serial number**. |
| **Q32** | How would you use a Wireshark filter to detect a potential **Heartbleed** attack signature? | TLS/Security | You would look for repeated **TLS Heartbeat** extension packets (part of the handshake/extension) with suspicious lengths or patterns, specifically a **Heartbeat Request** with a large payload length field followed by a small actual payload. |
| **Q33** | What does a high percentage of **out-of-order** packets in a TCP stream suggest? | TCP/Performance | Network path asymmetry, load balancing issues, or heavy congestion causing different segments of the same flow to take different paths with varying latency. |
| **Q34** | Explain **TCP SACK (Selective Acknowledgment)** and how it appears in a packet trace. | TCP | SACK is an optional feature allowing a receiver to inform the sender about **discontinuities** in the sequence of received data (i.e., which segments arrived out-of-order), improving retransmission efficiency. It appears in the **TCP Options field**. |
| **Q35** | How can packet analysis help you identify **Vulnerability Scanning** activity? | Security | Look for sequential packets originating from a single source IP that probe many different ports on a target, or that contain **unique payloads/signatures** matching known scanner tools like **Nessus** or **Nmap**. |
| **Q36** | What is the purpose of the **Grep** utility when used with **tcpdump** or **tshark** output? | Tools | **Grep** is used to **search for specific text strings** within the packet data (payload), which is useful for quickly locating usernames, passwords, or command-and-control strings. |
| **Q37** | How can you confirm that a host is using **DHCP** for its IP assignment versus a static IP? | DHCP/Analysis | Look for the **DHCP DORA sequence** (**Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge**) initiated by the host's MAC address at the start of the capture. |
| **Q38** | When analyzing a suspicious internal communication flow, what information can you gather from the **HTTP Host** header? | HTTP/Recon | It reveals the **domain name** the client was trying to reach, which is critical for identifying potential phishing sites or communication with malicious external services. |
| **Q39** | What is **tshark** and why is it preferred over Wireshark in automated security analysis? | Tools | **tshark** is the **command-line version of Wireshark**. It is preferred because it can be easily scripted, run on headless servers, and is more efficient for large-scale, automated analysis or piping data to other tools. |
| **Q40** | How do you detect **DNS Tunneling**? | DNS/Security | Look for **unusually large DNS query/response packets** (often exceeding 255 bytes) that contain non-standard or highly-encoded data strings being passed through the DNS protocol payload. |
| **Q41** | What is the significance of the **Urgent Pointer** field in a TCP header? | TCP | It indicates that certain data within the segment should be processed **urgently** by the receiving application. It is rarely used correctly, but attackers may use it to bypass network filters or create anomalous traffic. |
| **Q42** | How can you determine if a captured packet is coming from a **wireless network**? | 802.11/Layer 2 | The frame will contain an **802.11 header** (Layer 2) instead of a standard Ethernet II header, including fields for **Management Frames**, **Sequence Control**, and four MAC addresses (Source, Destination, Transmitter, Receiver). |
| **Q43** | What is a **WPA2 4-Way Handshake** and why is capturing it essential for ethical cracking? | 802.11/Security | It's the exchange of four EAPOL messages used to derive the session key. **Capturing all four messages** is mandatory for an offline brute-force attack against the Pre-Shared Key (PSK). |
| **Q44** | How would you filter a trace to look specifically for failed authentication attempts to an SSH server? | SSH/Analysis | You'd filter for the TCP port `tcp.port == 22` and then look for the **TCP Reset (RST)** flag or an abrupt connection close after the banner exchange, indicating a connection failure/rejection. |
| **Q45** | What is the risk of having a default or easily guessable **SNMP Community String** in your capture? | SNMP/Security | A cleartext community string (like "public") allows an attacker to use a tool to read the contents of the device's MIB (Management Information Base), leading to **extensive reconnaissance** on the device's configuration. |
| **Q46** | How can a packet analyst determine if a file downloaded via HTTP was potentially tampered with during transit? | HTTP/Integrity | By comparing the file's computed **hash** (e.g., MD5/SHA256) after extraction from the capture against the **Content-MD5** or **ETag** headers provided in the HTTP response (if available). |
| **Q47** | What information can be gleaned from analyzing **NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)** traffic? | Name Resolution/Recon | **Hostnames** and **IP-to-name mappings** of Windows machines on the local network, often used by attackers (via tools like Responder) for hash poisoning. |
| **Q48** | Describe a situation where a **tshark statistical report** would be more useful than simply scrolling through packets. | Tools/Analysis | For identifying **anomalies** such as the **top 10 talkers** by volume (DoS or data exfiltration), the **distribution of protocols** (covert channel detection), or high rates of **TCP resets/retransmissions** (network failure analysis). |
| **Q49** | How do you filter out all traffic that is considered "normal background noise" from a trace? | Tools/Efficiency | Filter out common multicast/broadcast traffic using BPF: `not (multicast or broadcast)`. Or display filter: `not (arp or stp or dhcp or cdp)`. |
| **Q50** | What is the purpose of the **Initial Sequence Number (ISN)** in TCP from a security perspective? | TCP/Security | The ISN should be **randomized** to prevent **TCP Sequence Prediction Attacks**, where an attacker attempts to guess the next sequence number to hijack an active session. |
| **Q51** | How can you use packet analysis to identify hosts attempting to join an unauthorized **VLAN**? | Layer 2/Security | Look for unexpected **802.1Q (VLAN tag)** headers in frames originating from an access port that should not be configured as a trunk. |
| **Q52** | When analyzing VoIP traffic, what two protocols carry the signaling and the voice data, respectively? | VoIP | **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)** carries the signaling (call setup), and **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)** carries the actual voice payload (data). |
| **Q53** | How would you extract a complete **RTP audio stream** from a VoIP capture? | VoIP/Tools | Use Wireshark's **Telephony -> VoIP Calls** menu to analyze the SIP session, then select the call and use **Flows -> RTP Stream** to play back the audio payload. |
| **Q54** | What is the security risk associated with having **multicast DNS (mDNS)** traffic in a corporate environment? | DNS/Recon | mDNS allows hosts to resolve names on the local link without a central server (Apple Bonjour, Avahi). It reveals **hostnames and service information** in an easily sniffed manner, aiding reconnaissance. |
| **Q55** | How can you spot the usage of a **proxy server** in an unencrypted HTTP packet trace? | HTTP/Recon | Look for the **`X-Forwarded-For`** header in the request, which often reveals the original client's IP address, or analyze the connection flow for an intermediate server IP. |
| **Q56** | When debugging a Kerberos authentication failure, what packet status should you look for? | Kerberos/Authentication | Look for the **KRB Error (KRB-ERROR)** message, specifically noting the **error code** (e.g., KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN) in the response from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). |
| **Q57** | Why is it difficult to analyze traffic after a security event if the packet capture was started late? | Forensics | A late start means the crucial **initial steps** of the attack (**reconnaissance, initial foothold, and session key exchange**) are **missing**, making root cause analysis difficult or impossible. |
| **Q58** | How would you use a display filter to view traffic that has a destination port number greater than 1024 (non-well-known ports)? | Tools | `tcp.dstport > 1024 or udp.dstport > 1024`. |
| **Q59** | In an incident response scenario, how can a packet capture confirm or deny a **data exfiltration** event? | Forensics | By measuring the **volume of data** sent to external, suspicious destinations over a specific period, checking if the size exceeds the expected baseline (using `Statistics -> I/O Graphs` or `Conversations`). |
| **Q60** | What is **"Protocol Decryption"** in Wireshark, and what is its main prerequisite? | Security/Tools | It's the process of using **cryptographic keys** (like a server's private key for TLS or a PSK for WPA2) to reveal the cleartext payload within an encrypted capture. The prerequisite is **having the necessary key**. |
| **Q61** | What are **Management Frames** in 802.11, and how are they exploited in wireless attacks? | 802.11/Security | They are used for network maintenance (e.g., **Deauthentication**, **Association**, **Probe Request/Response**). They are exploited because they are **not authenticated** in older Wi-Fi standards, allowing attackers to inject forged frames to perform DoS or force handshakes. |
| **Q62** | How would you distinguish between a valid **VLAN Tag (802.1Q)** and a standard Ethernet frame in a capture? | Layer 2 | The presence of a **4-byte tag** inserted after the Source MAC address. This tag contains the **Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)** and the 12-bit **VLAN ID**. |
| **Q63** | What is the purpose of the **PDU (Protocol Data Unit)** field in the Wireshark packet detail pane? | Tools | The PDU pane displays the **hierarchy of protocols** in the selected packet (e.g., Frame -> Ethernet -> IP -> TCP -> HTTP), allowing the user to inspect headers at each layer. |
| **Q64** | How can packet analysis help uncover **DNS exfiltration** where data is sent one character at a time? | DNS/Analysis | Look for a large number of **consecutive DNS queries** to a suspicious domain, where the **subdomain names** consist of long, encoded strings of varying, non-dictionary characters. |
| **Q65** | When analyzing **NetFlow** or **IPFIX** data, what key piece of information is gathered that a raw packet capture misses? | Management/Forensics | Flow records summarize high-volume metadata (e.g., source IP, destination IP, ports, start/end time, total bytes/packets) without the **payload**, making it highly scalable for long-term monitoring. |
| **Q66** | What is a **Wormhole Attack** in a routing protocol, and how would it appear in a trace? | Routing/Security | Two malicious nodes tunnel packets between them over a covert channel. It appears as legitimate traffic making an **unusually short hop** between two geographically distant or topologically disconnected nodes. |
| **Q67** | How can a hacker use packet analysis to identify a **Subdomain Enumeration** attempt? | DNS/Recon | Look for a source IP rapidly querying for sequential or dictionary-based subdomains of a target domain (e.g., `www.target.com`, `mail.target.com`, `ftp.target.com`). |
| **Q68** | What is the purpose of the **MD5/SHA256 Hash Calculation** feature in some packet analysis tools? | Forensics | It's used to verify the **integrity** of the captured file itself (the `.pcap`), ensuring it hasn't been modified since the time of collection. |
| **Q69** | How do you detect a **NULL Scan** (`-sN` in Nmap) using a packet analyzer? | TCP/Security | Look for TCP packets with **no flags set** (Flags field = 0x00) sent to various ports. If a closed port, the target sends an **RST/ACK**. If open/filtered, no response. |
| **Q70** | When analyzing a web server breach, why is the **HTTP Referer header** important? | HTTP/Forensics | It indicates the **previous page** the user visited. It can trace the attack vector, showing if the user arrived via a phishing link or an exploited internal page. |
| **Q71** | How can you use **I/O Graphs** in Wireshark to spot a Denial of Service (DoS) attack? | Tools/DoS | Look for an immediate, massive spike in the **packets-per-second** (PPS) or **bits-per-second** (BPS) graph, clearly above the established baseline traffic volume. |
| **Q72** | What is the security risk of seeing an unencrypted **LLMNR/NBT-NS** response in a capture? | Name Resolution/Security | These responses can be poisoned by attackers (e.g., using **Responder** tool) to trick the requesting host into sending their **NTLMv2 password hash** in response to the false resolution. |
| **Q73** | What does an **ICMP Destination Unreachable** message (Code 3: Port Unreachable) confirm about a target? | ICMP/Recon | It confirms that the target **host is online and reachable**, but no application is listening on the specified port. |
| **Q74** | How would you identify the usage of **SSH Tunneling** (port forwarding) in a trace? | SSH/Security | The initial connection is on port 22, but the subsequent data flow will show **encrypted application data** over the SSH stream, potentially connecting to an unusual internal IP/port that is masked by the tunnel. |
| **Q75** | In an IPsec VPN analysis, why are the initial packets often labeled **ISAKMP** or **IKE**? | IPsec | These protocols are used to establish the **Security Association (SA)** and exchange keys (Phase 1/2) *before* the actual IPsec-protected data (ESP) begins flowing. |
| **Q76** | What is the security advantage of using **sFlow** or **NetFlow** over full packet capture? | Management/Efficiency | They capture only **metadata** (flow records) which requires significantly less storage and processing power, making long-term network visibility feasible, though lacking payload detail. |
| **Q77** | How can you filter a capture for all packets that have an invalid **IP Checksum**? | IP/Tools | Use the display filter `ip.checksum.status == 1` (or the equivalent setting, depending on the tool version) to look for packets flagged as potentially corrupted or malicious. |
| **Q78** | What evidence in a capture confirms a successful **DHCP Rogue Server** attack? | DHCP/Security | Look for **DHCP Offer** packets originating from two different source MAC addresses (the legitimate server and the rogue server) offering IP addresses to the same client. |
| **Q79** | When analyzing an executable file transfer, what specific MIME type would you look for in the HTTP response? | HTTP/Forensics | Look for the **Content-Type** header matching `application/octet-stream` or `application/x-msdownload`, indicating an executable or raw binary file transfer. |
| **Q80** | How do you use the **Time Delta** column in Wireshark for security analysis? | Analysis | The Time Delta shows the time difference between the current packet and the **previous one**. Large, unusual gaps or highly regular, rapid-fire timing can indicate coordinated attack bursts or long-term covert communication. |
| **Q81** | What is **tshark's `-z conv`** option used for? | Tools | It displays the **statistics of conversations** (e.g., TCP, UDP, IP) showing total packets, bytes, and throughput for each pair of endpoints, useful for quickly identifying high-volume communication flows. |
| **Q82** | When analyzing an outbound connection, what is the significance of the client using a **high-numbered source port** (above 49151)? | TCP/General | It confirms the port is an **ephemeral port**, which is the standard behavior for client-side applications initiating outbound connections. |
| **Q83** | What would you look for in a capture to identify a successful **BGP Hijacking** attempt? | BGP/Routing | The appearance of an **unauthorized BGP UPDATE message** announcing a prefix (IP range) that is normally owned by a different Autonomous System (AS). |
| **Q84** | How can packet analysis determine if a password hash was used for authentication instead of a cleartext password? | Authentication | By inspecting the protocol payload: cleartext protocols (Telnet) show the password itself, while protocols like **Kerberos** or **NTLM** only show encrypted tickets or challenges/responses. |
| **Q85** | What is the key limitation of using the **IP address** to filter an attack source in a large network capture? | IP/Forensics | The IP address can be easily **spoofed** (especially in connectionless attacks like UDP floods or ICMP attacks), meaning the source IP is unreliable. |
| **Q86** | How do you filter for packets containing a specific string (e.g., "admin") anywhere in the payload? | Tools | Use a display filter with the `contains` operator, typically specified by the layer being checked: `frame contains "admin"`. |
| **Q87** | What is the role of the **Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)** field in IP packets in forensic analysis? | IP/QoS | It allows classification of traffic. An attacker might use low-priority DSCP values to try and **hide their traffic** in the background or high-priority values for a DoS on network resources. |
| **Q88** | How would you use a capture to check for the **Weak Cipher Suites** being used in a server's TLS configuration? | TLS/Security | Filter for the TLS Handshake and examine the **Server Hello** message to see the negotiated `Cipher Suite` (e.g., looking for known weak ciphers like DES or RC4). |
| **Q89** | What is the minimum packet size for an Ethernet frame, and why is this relevant for forensic analysis? | Layer 2 | **64 bytes**. Packets smaller than 64 bytes (excluding the preamble/SFD) are considered **runts** and can indicate hardware errors or a deliberate attempt to evade security measures. |
| **Q90** | What is the purpose of the **Gnuplot** utility when integrated with **tshark**? | Tools | Gnuplot is used to **visualize statistical data** generated by `tshark` (like I/O rate, packet distribution, or protocol usage) by creating graphs, which is essential for identifying anomalies. |
| **Q91** | What is the primary defense against **Fragment Overlap Attacks** (like the old Teardrop attack)? | IP/Security | Ensuring that security devices (firewalls, IDSes) and operating systems are configured to perform **full IP packet reassembly** before inspection, which correctly identifies and handles overlapping fragment offsets. |
| **Q92** | How can packet analysis confirm that a host is using **IPv6** and not solely IPv4? | IP/Recon | Look for packets where the **EtherType** is $0x86DD$, or search for specific **ICMPv6** messages like Router Solicitation/Advertisement or Neighbor Discovery. |
| **Q93** | When analyzing a tunneling protocol like **GRE**, what is the key piece of information that remains unencrypted? | Encapsulation | The **outer IP header** (source/destination IP and port of the tunnel endpoints) and the **GRE header** itself remain in cleartext, revealing the communication path. |
| **Q94** | How would you filter a trace to look for traffic using the **Kerberos** authentication protocol? | Kerberos/Authentication | Filter for `kerberos` or by its standard UDP/TCP port `udp.port == 88 or tcp.port == 88`. |
| **Q95** | What is the forensic significance of finding a cleartext **GET /robots.txt** request in a web server capture? | HTTP/Recon | It confirms an attacker or a bot was performing **initial reconnaissance** to find paths the site owner prefers to keep private (though not technically secret). |
| **Q96** | How do you detect a simple **UDP Flood** (DoS) using `tshark`? | UDP/DoS | Use the I/O statistics (`-z io,phs`) to identify a massive, sustained spike in packets/bytes using the **UDP protocol** directed at a single target IP/port. |
| **Q97** | When inspecting an HTTP session, what does an **HTTP 401 response** indicate, and why is it important in a capture? | HTTP/Security | It means **Unauthorized**. It's important because it usually triggers the client to send the next request with an **Authorization header** (often containing Basic/NTLM credentials), which may be in cleartext. |
| **Q98** | What does the term **"taps"** refer to in the context of professional packet capture? | Tools/Forensics | Hardware **Test Access Points**. These are physical devices that non-intrusively copy all traffic passing through a network link (full duplex) for 100% reliable capture, unlike SPAN/mirror ports. |
| **Q99** | How can you confirm that a host is running an **unsecured SMB (Server Message Block)** service? | Application/Security | Look for traffic on ports 139 (NetBIOS) or 445 (SMB) and examine the payload for **cleartext negotiation** or file transfer details, indicating a lack of encryption. |
| **Q100** | What is the purpose of the **"Analyze -> Expert Information"** menu in Wireshark? | Tools/Analysis | It summarizes critical network issues detected by Wireshark's protocol analyzers, categorizing them as **Errors, Warnings, Notes, or Chats**, allowing quick identification of connection problems or attack indicators. |
| **Q101** | What is the security risk of finding repeated, failed attempts to connect to **SNMP port 161** in a trace? | SNMP/Security | It suggests an attacker is actively attempting to **guess or brute-force** the community strings (`public`, `private`, etc.) to gain access to device management information. |
| **Q102** | How would you use a trace to confirm that **Split Tunneling** is enabled on a remote access VPN? | VPN/Security | Look for two simultaneous, separate connection flows originating from the remote client's machine: one flow entering the VPN tunnel (encrypted) and another flow going **directly to the internet** (unencrypted). |
| **Q103** | When analyzing a suspicious internal transfer, what is the forensic significance of finding data transferred over **ICMP**? | ICMP/Security | It points to a highly sophisticated **covert channel** (ICMP Tunneling) where data is hidden in the Echo Request/Reply payload to bypass simple firewall rules that only permit `ping`. |
| **Q104** | How do you filter for packets where the TTL (Time to Live) is below a suspicious threshold (e.g., TTL < 3)? | IP/Tools | Use the display filter: `ip.ttl < 3`. This helps identify packets that have traversed many hops or, conversely, highly localized attackers. |
| **Q105** | What is the key forensic benefit of analyzing **DNS queries** even when the malicious activity uses HTTPS? | DNS/Forensics | The **DNS query (the domain name)** is often the first, unencrypted clue linking the compromised host to the external Command and Control (C2) server, regardless of the subsequent encrypted connection. |
| **Q106** | How can you distinguish between a genuine **BGP reset** and an attacker-injected BGP reset in a capture? | BGP/Routing | Analyze the **BGP NOTIFICATION message**. An injected reset will often show the reset coming from an unexpected neighbor's IP or contain inconsistent/manipulated error codes. |
| **Q107** | What is **Wire Data Analysis**? | General | The process of analyzing network packet data (including header and payload) in real-time or near real-time to gain operational, performance, and security insights. |
| **Q108** | How would you detect a potential **Slowloris** DoS attack in a packet capture? | HTTP/DoS | Look for a high number of **HTTP GET requests** with abnormally long session durations, where the client sends the request headers **extremely slowly** (e.g., one header every 10-20 seconds) to tie up server resources. |
| **Q109** | What information can be gathered from analyzing **DHCP NAK (Negative Acknowledgement)** packets? | DHCP/Recon | NAKs indicate a failure in the address request (e.g., client moved to a different subnet, server is rejecting the request). High NAK rates can indicate misconfiguration or potential rogue activity. |
| **Q110** | When analyzing a **WPA/WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X)** session, what protocol is used to convey the authentication credentials? | 802.11/Security | **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**, which runs inside the EAPOL (EAP over LAN) frames during the authentication stage before the 4-Way Handshake. |
| **Q111** | How can you confirm that captured packets are being dropped by a **Firewall** based solely on the trace? | Security/Analysis | Look for **SYN** packets sent by the client with **no corresponding SYN-ACK** or **RST** response from the server, indicating the packet was dropped silently. |
| **Q112** | What does a high correlation between **SYN packets and ARP requests** suggest in an attack trace? | Recon/ARP | It suggests the attacker is performing a rapid **ARP discovery** of a network segment followed immediately by an **Nmap scan** of the discovered hosts. |
| **Q113** | How would you use packet analysis to detect the use of a tool like **Metasploit's reverse shell**? | C2/Forensics | Look for suspicious connections originating from the **internal host** (instead of inbound) connecting to an external IP on an unusual, high port (e.g., $4444$) carrying application data. |
| **Q114** | When analyzing **VoIP calls (RTP)**, what field is critical for reordering the audio packets correctly? | RTP | The **Sequence Number** field within the RTP header, which tells the jitter buffer the correct order of the packets for playback. |
| **Q115** | What is the difference between a **TCP window update** and a **TCP zero window** packet? | TCP/Flow Control | A **Zero Window** is a temporary halt. A **Window Update** is a small packet sent by the receiver to inform the sender that space is now available in the buffer, allowing data transmission to resume. |
| **Q116** | How do you filter for packets that have an IPv4 header length greater than the standard 20 bytes? | IP/Tools | Use the filter `ip.hdr_len > 20`. This flags packets with **IP Options** enabled, which can be suspicious as it's rarely used legitimately. |
| **Q117** | What is the main security purpose of filtering for **Gratuitous ARP** packets? | ARP/Security | To monitor changes in MAC-to-IP mappings. A sudden, large number of unsolicited Gratuitous ARPs can signal an active **ARP spoofing** attack or a network configuration error. |
| **Q118** | How can packet analysis help you detect a **SQL Injection** attack? | HTTP/Application | Examine the **URL parameters** and **HTTP POST body** (if unencrypted) for common SQL keywords, logic operators (`OR`, `'--`), or heavily encoded strings sent to a web application. |
| **Q119** | What is the significance of the **IPv6 Flow Label** field in forensic analysis? | IPv6 | It's intended to mark packets belonging to the same traffic flow. An attacker might manipulate this to force related malicious packets to follow a specific path, potentially bypassing security filters based on simple source/destination pairs. |
| **Q120** | What is a **Wormhole** in the context of file extraction from a trace? | Forensics | A user-defined boundary or filter that allows a packet analyst to isolate a specific segment of a session (e.g., between a login success and a logout) for targeted file or data extraction. |
| **Q121** | What is **Jitter** in a packet stream, and how would you analyze it in Wireshark? | RTP/VoIP | Jitter is the **variation in the delay** between when packets arrive, commonly seen in RTP streams. Analyze it in Wireshark using **Statistics -> RTP -> Stream Analysis**, looking for high maximum jitter values. |
| **Q122** | How can packet analysis help you confirm a successful **DNS Rebinding** attack? | DNS/Security | By observing the **DNS response TTL** being set very low (e.g., 0 or 1 second) and tracking subsequent requests where the client is successfully redirected to a **local, internal IP address** after initially resolving an external malicious domain. |
| **Q123** | When analyzing a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, what common network anomaly distinguishes the **botnet traffic** from normal traffic? | DoS/Analysis | The traffic often exhibits high **rate consistency** (many packets of the same size, timing, and often the same flags) originating from a **large number of disparate source IPs**. |
| **Q124** | What is the purpose of the **"Compare"** feature when analyzing two separate packet capture files? | Tools/Forensics | It helps forensic analysts quickly identify **differences in network behavior** before and after an attack, or compare the traffic patterns of a compromised host versus a clean host. |
| **Q125** | How do you filter for traffic that has been routed through a specific **gateway IP** (e.g., $10.10.10.1$)? | IP/Tools | Filter by the **router's MAC address** as the destination MAC for traffic leaving the local segment: `eth.dst == [router_mac]` and then correlate with the gateway IP. |
| **Q126** | What are the security implications of seeing **STP BPDU** frames arriving on an access port that is configured with **PortFast**? | STP/Security | This is a violation of the PortFast configuration and often triggers a **BPDU Guard** defense (shutting down the port), indicating either a switch loop or an attacker attempting a **Root Bridge takeover**. |
| **Q127** | How can a hacker use packet analysis to discover a target's internal **VLAN assignments**? | Layer 2/Recon | By passively sniffing **CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)** or **LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)** traffic (if present), which often broadcast configuration details, including connected VLAN IDs. |
| **Q128** | What is **Data Carving** in network forensics? | Forensics | The process of **extracting files or data fragments** from the raw packet payload without relying on the file system structure, often used to recover artifacts like images, executables, or documents from `.pcap` files. |
| **Q129** | When analyzing **NTP** traffic, what could an attacker manipulate to cause log corruption or failed authentication? | NTP | The attacker could forge an NTP response packet with an **incorrect time or date**, causing the target host to update its clock incorrectly, thus invalidating time-based security mechanisms like Kerberos. |
| **Q130** | How do you filter a trace to look for connections using the **SOCKS proxy protocol**? | Application/Tools | Filter by common SOCKS ports: `tcp.port == 1080` (SOCKS5) or analyze the connection flow for the SOCKS **handshake sequence** within the TCP payload. |
| **Q131** | What is the significance of the **Ethernet Frame Type 0x0806** in a Layer 2 analysis? | Layer 2/ARP | It explicitly identifies the frame as carrying an **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** packet, which is critical for identifying local MITM attempts. |
| **Q132** | How can you use packet analysis to detect the use of a **VPN or encrypted tunneling** protocol over a non-standard port? | Security/Analysis | Look for a high volume of traffic on an unusual port that is **high entropy** (highly randomized, incompressible payload data), indicating the use of encryption. |
| **Q133** | When inspecting an email transfer via **SMTP**, what header is critical for tracking the message path? | SMTP/Forensics | The **Received** header, which is added by every mail server that handles the message, allowing forensic tracing of the route the email took from sender to recipient. |
| **Q134** | What is **TCP Window Scaling** and why might an attacker disable it in their packets? | TCP | A TCP option that allows the window size to exceed $65,535$ bytes. An attacker might disable it or use very small windows to **control the rate of data flow** precisely or avoid detection by systems configured for high-speed traffic analysis. |
| **Q135** | How can you confirm that a network interface is using **MAC Spoofing**? | Layer 2/Security | Look for two distinct flows where packets originating from the same **IP address** are associated with **two different source MAC addresses** over a short period. |
| **Q136** | What is the purpose of the **"Mark Packet"** feature in Wireshark during a complex investigation? | Tools | It allows the analyst to **highlight specific packets** (e.g., the first packet of an attack, a critical command) for easy reference and retrieval later in the analysis or documentation. |
| **Q137** | How can packet analysis help you identify a system configured with a **"Default Password"**? | Application/Security | Look for authentication attempts via cleartext protocols (FTP, Telnet) or even encrypted protocols (e.g., HTTP POST to a login form) where the credential string matches a known default like `admin:admin`. |
| **Q138** | When analyzing a **Kerberos** TGS-REQ/TGS-REP (Ticket-Granting Service) exchange, what potential attack should you be looking for? | Kerberos/Security | **Kerberoasting**: an attacker requesting a service ticket for a **service account** (e.g., $HTTP/SQL$) which they can then crack offline to retrieve the password hash. |
| **Q139** | What is the challenge in using **SPAN/Mirror** ports for capture in high-utilization environments? | Tools/Performance | A busy SPAN port can suffer from **packet dropping** (over-subscription) because the monitoring port cannot keep up with the aggregated traffic rate, leading to incomplete forensic traces. |
| **Q140** | How do you filter for packets that have an **unusually short frame length**? | Layer 2/Tools | Filter using `frame.len < [threshold]` (e.g., `frame.len < 64`) to look for runts, which can indicate malicious activity or hardware malfunction. |
| **Q141** | What is the risk of enabling **ICMP Redirects** on a router, and how can analysis confirm its exploitation? | ICMP/Routing | It allows a router to suggest a better path, but an attacker can inject malicious redirects. Analysis shows the client accepting a **malicious gateway IP** from a fake router redirect message. |
| **Q142** | What does a high volume of **HTTP 404 (Not Found)** errors originating from a single source often indicate? | HTTP/Recon | An attacker or bot is likely performing **content discovery** or **directory brute-forcing** to find hidden files and directories on the web server. |
| **Q143** | How can you use packet analysis to determine if a connection is **using a proxy (SOCKS or HTTP)**? | HTTP/Application | For HTTP, look for the use of the **CONNECT** method or the **Proxy-Authorization** header. For SOCKS, look for the SOCKS version and command in the initial handshake payload. |
| **Q144** | What is the forensic importance of documenting the **absolute timestamps** of a packet capture? | Forensics | It provides the **time synchronization** necessary to correlate network events with system logs (Syslog, Windows Event Logs) during incident reconstruction. |
| **Q145** | How would you detect a potential **Lateral Movement** event using packet analysis? | Forensics | Look for unexpected **internal-to-internal** connections (e.g., RDP, SSH, PowerShell Remoting) originating from a recently compromised host, establishing command and control on another internal machine. |
| **Q146** | In an **SMB** file transfer, what field in the frame header is crucial for linking the file name to the transfer data? | SMB/Application | The **File ID (FID)** or **Tree ID (TID)** in the SMB header, which is used throughout the session to reference the specific file or shared resource. |
| **Q147** | What is the difference between a **TCP window update** and a **TCP zero window** packet? | TCP/Flow Control | A **Zero Window** is a temporary halt. A **Window Update** is a small packet sent by the receiver to inform the sender that space is now available in the buffer, allowing data transmission to resume. |
| **Q148** | What is the primary method of filtering out noise (like local broadcast traffic) using **tcpdump** on a live interface? | Tools | Using **BPF syntax** with the `not` keyword (e.g., `not arp and not port 5353`), or filtering traffic based on the network interface's local subnet. |
| **Q149** | How can you confirm that a host is running an outdated or vulnerable version of a protocol, like **TLS 1.0**? | TLS/Security | By examining the **Client Hello** message in the TLS handshake, which explicitly states the highest **TLS Version** the client is willing to support. |
| **Q150** | What is the role of the **Summary Report** in final forensic documentation? | Forensics | It provides a **high-level narrative** of the attack (who, what, when, where, and how much data was lost) based on the evidence collected from the packet analysis, translating technical findings into business intelligence. |
