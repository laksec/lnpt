## 🔒 Set 1: TCP/IP, ICMP, and ARP Fundamentals (Q1-Q30)

### ❓ Networking Protocols Interview Questions & Answers

| No. | Question | Protocol/Layer | Answer (Ethical Hacker Context) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1** | What is the primary difference between **TCP** and **UDP**? | Transport | **TCP** is **Connection-Oriented** (guarantees delivery, sequencing, and error checking, using the 3-Way Handshake). **UDP** is **Connectionless** (faster, but unreliable, used for applications like DNS, VoIP, and video streaming). |
| **Q2** | Explain the steps of the **TCP 3-Way Handshake**. | TCP | **SYN** (Client requests connection) -> **SYN-ACK** (Server acknowledges and responds) -> **ACK** (Client acknowledges). This establishes a reliable connection. |
| **Q3** | What is a **SYN Flood Attack**? | TCP | An attack where the attacker sends many TCP **SYN** requests without completing the 3-Way Handshake (never sending the final **ACK**). This exhausts the server's resources (Tear-down Half-Open connections), causing a DoS. |
| **Q4** | How does **TCP establish connection termination**? | TCP | It uses a **4-Way Handshake**: **FIN** (Sender requests close) -> **ACK** (Receiver acknowledges FIN) -> **FIN** (Receiver requests close) -> **ACK** (Sender acknowledges). |
| **Q5** | What is the purpose of the **TCP Sequence Number** and **Acknowledgement Number**? | TCP | **Sequence Number** tracks the order of bytes sent in a segment. **Acknowledgement Number** is the next sequence number the receiver expects to receive, ensuring reliable, ordered delivery. |
| **Q6** | What is **IP Fragmentation**, and why might an attacker use it? | IP | Breaking a large IP packet into smaller pieces (fragments) to pass through networks with smaller **MTU** (Maximum Transmission Unit) limits. An attacker uses it to **evade IDS/IPS** that might only inspect the first fragment. |
| **Q7** | Which protocol is used by the **`ping`** utility, and on what layer does it operate? | ICMP | **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol), which operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**. |
| **Q8** | Name two common **ICMP message types** an attacker might abuse. | ICMP | **Echo Request/Reply** (Type 8/0, used for simple reconnaissance/ping sweeps) and **Time Exceeded** (Type 11, used in the **traceroute** utility, also potentially for path analysis). |
| **Q9** | What is the function of **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol)? | ARP | It translates a **Layer 3 IP address** into a **Layer 2 MAC address** so data can be physically delivered on a local segment. |
| **Q10** | Explain an **ARP Spoofing/Poisoning** attack. | ARP | An attacker sends forged ARP responses to the local network, falsely associating their **MAC address** with the **IP address** of another host (like the gateway). This allows them to **intercept (man-in-the-middle)** traffic. |
| **Q11** | What is the significance of the **TTL** (Time to Live) field in an IP header? | IP | It limits the lifespan of a packet. Each router decrements the TTL by 1; when it reaches 0, the packet is discarded, preventing packets from endlessly looping and exhausting network resources. |
| **Q12** | What are **well-known ports**, and give two examples. | Transport | Ports numbered **0 to 1023** reserved for common Internet services. Examples: **HTTP (80)** and **FTP Control (21)**. |
| **Q13** | What is the purpose of the **Flags** field in a TCP header? | TCP | Contains control bits to manage the connection, such as **SYN** (synchronize), **ACK** (acknowledge), **FIN** (finish), **RST** (reset), **PSH** (push), and **URG** (urgent). |
| **Q14** | How does **UDP** achieve its low latency for applications like VoIP? | UDP | By eliminating the overhead of connection establishment, ordered delivery, flow control, and error checking, trading reliability for speed. |
| **Q15** | What is the maximum size of a standard IPv4 header (without options)? | IP | **20 bytes**. |
| **Q16** | What is the main difference between a **private IP address** and a **public IP address**? | IP | **Private IPs** are reserved for internal networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x) and are **not routable** on the public internet. **Public IPs** are unique globally and **are routable** on the internet. |
| **Q17** | What is **NAT** (Network Address Translation), and how does it relate to security? | IP/Security | It maps multiple **private IPs** to a single **public IP** (or a pool). It provides a degree of security by **hiding internal IP addresses** from the external network. |
| **Q18** | What is the **Subnet Mask**'s role? | IP | It defines which portion of the IP address identifies the **network** and which portion identifies the **host**. It determines the boundaries of a local network segment. |
| **Q19** | Which two ICMP message types are used for **Path MTU Discovery**? | ICMP | **Destination Unreachable** (specifically code 4: Fragmentation needed, but Don't Fragment (DF) bit set). |
| **Q20** | How can an attacker use **ICMP Redirect** messages? | ICMP | To trick a host into sending traffic through a different, potentially malicious, gateway (router), effectively allowing for a Man-in-the-Middle attack. |
| **Q21** | What is the **Window Size** field in a TCP header? | TCP | It specifies the amount of data (in bytes) that a receiver is willing to accept before receiving an acknowledgment, used for **Flow Control**. |
| **Q22** | Why do firewalls often block **incoming ICMP** by default? | ICMP/Security | To prevent **reconnaissance** (ping sweeps), **DoS attacks** (ICMP floods, like the Smurf attack), and **fingerprinting** of internal hosts. |
| **Q23** | What is a **Gratuitous ARP**? | ARP | An ARP reply sent without a prior request. It's typically used to **update the ARP tables** of other hosts or to announce a change (like a failover or a new IP). |
| **Q24** | In the context of port scanning, what is a **TCP NULL Scan**? | TCP | A scan where the attacker sends a TCP segment with **no flags set**. If the port is **open**, the target sends nothing back. If the port is **closed**, the target sends an **RST/ACK**. (Used to bypass some simple firewalls). |
| **Q25** | What is **Source Routing** in IP, and why is it often disabled? | IP | Allows the sender of a packet to dictate the path the packet should take across the network. It's often disabled because it's a **security risk**, allowing attackers to bypass security checkpoints. |
| **Q26** | What is the purpose of the **RST** flag in TCP? | TCP | To **immediately terminate** a connection (a hard reset). It indicates an error or an attempt to quickly close a connection without the 4-way handshake. |
| **Q27** | How can a hacker use **ICMP Time-to-Live Exceeded** messages for mapping a network? | ICMP | By incrementing the TTL value in a packet, they force routers along the path to send back the TTL Exceeded message, revealing the router's IP address (the principle behind `traceroute`). |
| **Q28** | What is the role of the **IP Checksum** field? | IP | To provide a basic level of **error detection** for the IP header itself. (Note: TCP/UDP have their own checksums for the payload). |
| **Q29** | In ARP, what is the significance of the **Opcode** field? | ARP | It specifies the message type: **1** for an **ARP Request** (Who has this IP?), and **2** for an **ARP Reply** (I have that IP, here is my MAC). |
| **Q30** | Describe the vulnerability exploited by a **Land Attack**. | TCP | An attacker sends a SYN packet to a target where the **Source IP Address** and **Source Port** are the **same** as the **Destination IP Address** and **Destination Port** (the target's address). This confuses the target's TCP stack, causing a crash or freeze. |
| **Q31** | What is the fundamental function of **DNS**? | Application | **Domain Name System** translates human-readable **domain names** (e.g., example.com) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (e.g., 192.0.2.1), essential for network navigation. |
| **Q32** | Describe **DNS Zone Transfer** and its security implications. | DNS | A mechanism where a secondary DNS server requests a copy of the entire zone file from the primary server. If not properly restricted, an attacker can use this to gather a complete map of a target's network hosts. |
| **Q33** | What is **DNS Cache Poisoning**? | DNS | An attack where an attacker introduces false information into a DNS resolver's cache, causing users querying legitimate domains to be redirected to the attacker's malicious IP address. |
| **Q34** | What is the purpose of **DHCP**? | Application | **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server information to devices on a network. |
| **Q35** | Explain a **DHCP Starvation Attack**. | DHCP | An attacker floods the DHCP server with bogus **DHCP Request** packets using spoofed MAC addresses, rapidly consuming all available IP addresses in the pool, leading to a Denial of Service for legitimate clients. |
| **Q36** | What is the key difference between **HTTP** and **HTTPS**? | Application/Security | **HTTP** is unencrypted, transmitting data in plain text. **HTTPS** uses **TLS/SSL** encryption to secure the communication, preventing eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. |
| **Q37** | Name four common **HTTP methods** and their function. | HTTP | **GET** (Requests data from a specified resource), **POST** (Submits data to be processed to a specified resource), **PUT** (Replaces all current representations of the target resource), **DELETE** (Deletes the specified resource). |
| **Q38** | What does an **HTTP 302** status code signify? | HTTP | **Found (Redirect)**. It indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new URI. Hackers often look for chained or untrusted redirects. |
| **Q39** | What is a **Session Hijacking** attack, and how does it relate to HTTP? | HTTP/Security | An attacker steals or predicts a valid **session ID** (often stored in an HTTP cookie or URL parameter) to take over a user's authenticated session without needing a password. |
| **Q40** | How does **TLS/SSL** protect data confidentiality and integrity? | Security | **Confidentiality** is protected through **encryption** (e.g., AES). **Integrity** is protected through **cryptographic hashing** and **MACs** (Message Authentication Codes) to detect tampering. |
| **Q41** | Why are **Server Name Indication (SNI)** extensions necessary for modern HTTPS? | TLS | SNI allows a server to host **multiple SSL certificates** for different domain names on the same IP address, enabling the client to specify which domain they are trying to reach during the TLS handshake. |
| **Q42** | Describe the process of **SSL Stripping**. | TLS | An attack where a Man-in-the-Middle intercepts a victim's request to an HTTPS site and downgrades the connection to the unencrypted **HTTP** protocol, capturing all data in cleartext. |
| **Q43** | What is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), and why is it preferred over Telnet? | Application/Security | Port **22**. SSH is preferred because it **encrypts** all communication (including login credentials and commands), whereas Telnet sends everything in plaintext. |
| **Q44** | How can a hacker use **DHCP** for reconnaissance? | DHCP | By analyzing DHCP logs, an attacker can determine the **range of IP addresses** in use, the **lease times**, and potentially the **MAC addresses** and operating systems of devices on the network. |
| **Q45** | What is **DNSSEC** (Domain Name System Security Extensions)? | DNS | A suite of IETF specifications that add **cryptographic digital signatures** to DNS data, allowing DNS resolvers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the DNS information they receive. |
| **Q46** | In an HTTP request, what is the significance of the **User-Agent** header? | HTTP | It identifies the **client software** (e.g., browser, bot, mobile app) making the request. Hackers often spoof this header to evade detection or target specific server software. |
| **Q47** | What is the purpose of the **DHCP Relay Agent**? | DHCP | Allows hosts on a subnet that does not have a DHCP server to obtain IP addressing information. The relay agent forwards DHCP broadcasts across network boundaries to the server. |
| **Q48** | What is the **HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security) header? | HTTP/Security | A web security policy that forces browsers to only connect to a website using **HTTPS**, even if the user explicitly enters "http," mitigating SSL stripping and man-in-the-middle attacks. |
| **Q49** | Name a common security risk associated with the **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol). | Application | FTP transmits **passwords and file data in plain text** over the network, making it vulnerable to packet sniffing, especially when not using the secure version (SFTP or FTPS). |
| **Q50** | How does **FTP Passive Mode** differ from Active Mode? | FTP | In **Active Mode**, the server initiates the data connection back to the client. In **Passive Mode**, the client initiates both the control and the data connection, which is often necessary to traverse firewalls. |
| **Q51** | What is the risk associated with a web server exposing the **OPTIONS** HTTP method? | HTTP | The **OPTIONS** method requests information about the communication options supported by the target resource, which can expose too much information (like allowed methods) to an attacker for reconnaissance. |
| **Q52** | What are **CNAME** records in DNS? | DNS | A **Canonical Name** record maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical or primary name). Used for hosting multiple services under one server. |
| **Q53** | Describe a **DHCP Rogue Server** attack. | DHCP | An unauthorized DHCP server is set up on a network and begins offering invalid (or malicious) IP configuration (like setting the attacker's IP as the default gateway/DNS server) to clients. |
| **Q54** | Why is UDP preferred over TCP for **DNS** queries? | DNS/Transport | DNS queries are typically small, single request/response transactions. UDP's connectionless nature makes it faster, avoiding the 3-Way Handshake overhead. **TCP** is used for Zone Transfers. |
| **Q55** | What is the role of the **Referer** header in an HTTP request? | HTTP | It indicates the **address of the previous web page** from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. Can be used in security checks or abused in attacks like CSRF. |
| **Q56** | What is a **Wildcard SSL Certificate**, and what is its main risk? | Security | A single certificate used to secure a **main domain** and **all its subdomains** (e.g., \*https://www.google.com/search?q=.example.com). The risk is that if the private key is compromised, all subdomains are instantly vulnerable. |
| **Q57** | Name two protocols commonly used for encrypted file transfer. | Application/Security | **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and **FTPS** (FTP over SSL/TLS). |
| **Q58** | What is the main security risk when **SNMP** (Simple Network Management Protocol) is configured with default community strings? | Application/Security | Default strings (like `public` for read-only and `private` for read-write) allow an attacker to easily **map the network**, enumerate devices, and potentially even **change configurations** on network devices. |
| **Q59** | What is a **DNS Blackhole List** (DNSBL), and how is it used in defense? | DNS/Security | A list of IP addresses known to send spam or host malware. Mail servers query this list via DNS to decide whether to block incoming mail from those IPs. |
| **Q60** | How can a hacker use the **HTTP TRACE** method? | HTTP | The **TRACE** method echoes the received request back to the client. It is sometimes used in a **Cross-Site Tracing (XST) attack** to bypass security mechanisms and steal cookie information. |
| **Q61** | What is the main difference between **Distance Vector** and **Link-State** routing protocols? | Routing | **Distance Vector** (e.g., RIP) sends its **full routing table** to direct neighbors. **Link-State** (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS) sends information about its **directly connected links** to *all* routers, building a complete network map (SPF tree). |
| **Q62** | How can a hacker exploit a weakness in **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol)? | Routing | BGP relies on trust between peers. An attacker can perform a **BGP Hijacking** attack by announcing a prefix (IP range) they don't own, redirecting traffic intended for a legitimate destination to their network. |
| **Q63** | What is **OSPF's Designated Router (DR)**, and why is it a target for reconnaissance? | OSPF | The DR is chosen on multi-access segments (like Ethernet) to manage communication and synchronization between routers. Compromising the DR allows an attacker to control the flow and updates of routing information. |
| **Q64** | What is **MPLS** (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)? | Encapsulation | A high-performance forwarding technique that assigns **short, fixed-length labels** to packets at the ingress router, allowing intermediate routers to switch packets based on the label, rather than long IP lookups. |
| **Q65** | Describe a **Label Spoofing** attack in an MPLS environment. | MPLS | An attacker attempts to inject packets with unauthorized or manipulated MPLS labels into the network core, potentially bypassing security filters based on IP or port information. |
| **Q66** | What is the primary difference between a **Site-to-Site VPN** and a **Remote Access VPN**? | VPN | **Site-to-Site** connects **two or more networks** (e.g., two offices) through a permanent tunnel. **Remote Access** connects a **single end-user** (e.g., a teleworker) to the corporate network. |
| **Q67** | Which two protocols are commonly used to secure the tunnel in an **IPsec VPN**? | VPN/Security | **Authentication Header (AH)** for integrity and authentication, and **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)** for confidentiality (encryption) and optionally integrity. ESP is most common. |
| **Q68** | What is the main vulnerability of **PPTP** (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) that leads to its deprecation? | VPN | Its reliance on the **MS-CHAPv2** authentication protocol, which is known to be cryptographically weak and susceptible to offline dictionary and brute-force attacks. |
| **Q69** | What is **VLAN Hopping**? | Layer 2 | An attack that allows a device on one **VLAN** (Virtual LAN) to gain access to traffic on a different, restricted VLAN. The two common methods are **Switch Spoofing** and **Double Tagging**. |
| **Q70** | Explain the **Switch Spoofing** method of VLAN Hopping. | Layer 2 | The attacker's machine mimics a trunking link (like DTP) to convince the switch to change its port mode from access to trunk, granting the attacker access to all VLANs traversing that trunk. |
| **Q71** | What is the role of **STP** (Spanning Tree Protocol)? | Layer 2 | It prevents Layer 2 **switching loops** by logically blocking redundant paths in a network, ensuring only one active path between any two devices. |
| **Q72** | How can an attacker abuse **STP** using a **BPDU Guard** bypass? | STP | By compromising the root bridge, an attacker can manipulate the network topology, intercepting or redirecting traffic destined for other segments. |
| **Q73** | What is **MAC Flooding** (or **CAM Table Overflow**)? | Layer 2 | An attacker floods a switch with thousands of forged frames, each with a different source MAC address, eventually exhausting the switch's **CAM table** space and forcing the switch into **Fail Open** or **Hub mode** (flooding all traffic out all ports). |
| **Q74** | How can **DHCP Snooping** defend against attacks? | Layer 2/Security | It builds a database of trusted DHCP bindings (MAC-to-IP-to-Port), then **filters** all DHCP messages except those coming from trusted ports, mitigating Rogue DHCP Servers and ARP Spoofing. |
| **Q75** | What is a **GRE Tunnel** (Generic Routing Encapsulation)? | Encapsulation | A protocol that **encapsulates** one network layer protocol inside another (often IP inside IP). It is often used to build a basic, unencrypted VPN tunnel between two endpoints. |
| **Q76** | What is the potential security risk of using **split tunneling** in a Remote Access VPN? | VPN/Security | It allows user traffic destined for the corporate network to go through the VPN, but traffic destined for the public internet to go directly out, which could expose the corporate machine to external threats (like malware) without passing through the corporate firewalls. |
| **Q77** | What are **OSPF Areas**, and how do they aid in security and efficiency? | OSPF | Areas logically segment a large OSPF domain, confining routing updates and link-state changes within that area. This reduces computational overhead on routers and can segment attack blast radius. |
| **Q78** | In a **traceroute** output, what does an **asterisk (\*)** typically indicate? | ICMP/Routing | A **timeout**—no response was received from that router (hop) in the path. This could be due to an ICMP filter (firewall blocking the Time Exceeded message) or high network latency/congestion. |
| **Q79** | What is the security advantage of using **EBGP Multihop**? | BGP | It allows BGP peers that are not directly connected (not on the same subnet) to establish a peering session, often used when peering through an intermediate security device like a firewall, adding flexibility and control. |
| **Q80** | Describe the function of the **Access Control List (ACL)** in network security. | Security | An ordered set of **rules** applied to router or switch interfaces to **filter** network traffic (permit or deny) based on criteria like source/destination IP, port number, and protocol. |
| **Q81** | What is **Port Security** on a switch, and how does it mitigate MAC Flooding? | Layer 2/Security | A feature that restricts the number of valid **MAC addresses** allowed on a switch port, and can be configured to take action (e.g., shutdown the port) if the limit is exceeded. |
| **Q82** | Why might an attacker prioritize targeting the **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)** configuration? | Layer 2 | If the attacker compromises a VTP server, they can inject malicious VLAN configuration updates across the entire switch domain, potentially disrupting or merging VLANs for unauthorized access. |
| **Q83** | What is a **Transit Autonomous System (AS)** in BGP, and why is it a target? | BGP | An AS that allows traffic to pass *through* it between two other ASes. It is a target because controlling it gives the attacker the ability to **Man-in-the-Middle** traffic flowing across a large portion of the internet. |
| **Q84** | What is **Traffic Engineering** in the context of MPLS? | MPLS | The process of influencing the flow of data packets through a network to optimize performance, avoid congestion, or enforce policy—often done by manually manipulating the assigned labels. |
| **Q85** | What is **EAP** (Extensible Authentication Protocol)? | Authentication | An authentication framework used often in **802.1X** (Port-based Network Access Control) and wireless (WPA/WPA2) to provide a variety of authentication methods (e.g., tokens, certificates, passwords). |
| **Q86** | What is the difference between an **Inner Label** and an **Outer Label** in a nested MPLS/VPN structure? | MPLS | The **Outer Label** is used by the **core network routers** for routing between Provider (P) routers. The **Inner Label** identifies the customer's VPN service (VRF) at the Provider Edge (PE) router. |
| **Q87** | How does **ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)** relate to an attacker's gateway choice? | ICMP/Routing | IRDP allows hosts to discover the IP addresses of operational routers on the network. An attacker can broadcast false IRDP messages to redirect legitimate hosts to their malicious gateway. |
| **Q88** | What is **802.1X**? | Layer 2/Security | A Port-based Network Access Control standard that requires users and devices to be **authenticated** before being granted full access to the network, preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to a switch port. |
| **Q89** | In an IPsec VPN, what is the role of the **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** protocol? | IPsec | IKE is responsible for **establishing and managing the Security Association (SA)** between the two endpoints, including negotiating the encryption and hashing algorithms and managing the exchange of cryptographic keys. |
| **Q90** | How can a hacker use **BPDU** (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) information for reconnaissance? | STP | By capturing BPDUs, an attacker can learn the **MAC address** of the Root Bridge, the switch **priorities**, the **port states**, and the general **topology** of the Layer 2 network before launching an attack. |
| **Q91** | What is the purpose of **NTP** (Network Time Protocol), and how can its manipulation be used in an attack? | Application | NTP synchronizes the time on networked devices. Manipulating time can defeat time-based authentication, disrupt log analysis, or interfere with security protocols that rely on synchronized clocks (e.g., Kerberos). |
| **Q92** | Describe the basic role of **SNMP** (Simple Network Management Protocol). | Application | Used for **managing and monitoring** network devices. Agents on the devices collect data and send it to a manager (NMS) via messages like GET/SET/TRAP. |
| **Q93** | How can a hacker exploit the **SNMP WRITE** community string? | SNMP | The **WRITE** string (e.g., `private`) grants permission to modify device configurations. An attacker can use it to remotely disable ports, change firewall rules, or even reset credentials. |
| **Q94** | What is **Wireless Deauthentication** and which protocol is exploited? | 802.11 | An attack where an attacker sends forged **Deauthentication frames** (part of the **802.11 management frames**) to one or all clients on an access point (AP), forcing them to disconnect, effectively acting as a DoS. |
| **Q95** | Why is the **WPA2 4-Way Handshake** targeted in attacks like the **KRACK** vulnerability? | 802.11 | The 4-Way Handshake is used to establish the session key (PTK). KRACK exploited weaknesses in the **reinstallation of the key** during the third step, allowing attackers to replay or decrypt frames. |
| **Q96** | What is a **PMKID** attack in WPA/WPA2 cracking? | 802.11 | The PMKID (Pairwise Master Key Identifier) is sent during the **first frame of the EAPOL handshake**. If captured, it can be used to perform an **offline brute-force attack** against the password, eliminating the need to wait for all four handshake frames. |
| **Q97** | What is a **Captive Portal**, and what is its main security risk? | HTTP/Wireless | A web page that forces a client to view and interact with it before being granted access to the network (common in hotels/airports). The risk is that the initial connection is often **unencrypted** and susceptible to monitoring. |
| **Q98** | What is **RADIUS** (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)? | AAA | A centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol often used with **802.1X** for remote user access and controlling access to network services. |
| **Q99** | Describe a **Pass-the-Hash** attack and its relevance to **Kerberos**. | Authentication | An attacker steals the **hash** of a user's password and uses it directly to authenticate to a network service *without* ever cracking the password. Kerberos's pre-authentication phase can be a target for hash harvesting. |
| **Q100** | What is the fundamental security difference between **POP3** and **IMAP**? | Application | Both are email retrieval protocols, but POP3 typically **downloads** and deletes the message from the server, while IMAP **stores** the message on the server, allowing access from multiple devices. The security concern is often the **unencrypted** transmission of credentials in both protocols unless TLS is used. |
| **Q101** | What is **RDP** (Remote Desktop Protocol), and what is a security risk associated with it? | Application | A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to graphically control a remote computer. The risk is often **brute-forcing weak credentials** or exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in the RDP service itself. |
| **Q102** | What is the **DTLS** (Datagram Transport Layer Security) protocol? | Security | A version of the TLS protocol designed to run over **UDP** instead of TCP, providing security for connectionless protocols like VoIP and VPNs where reordering and low latency are prioritized over guaranteed delivery. |
| **Q103** | How does **IPv6** improve security over IPv4? | IP | IPv6 mandate the inclusion of **IPsec** support (though not its enforcement), uses much larger address space (making simple scanning harder), and eliminates the need for NAT (reducing hiding-by-obscurity). |
| **Q104** | What is a **Neighbor Solicitation** message in IPv6? | ICMPv6 | The IPv6 equivalent of an ARP Request, used by a host to ask for the link-layer (MAC) address of a neighbor (like the default router). |
| **Q105** | Explain the risk of an **IPv6 Rogue Router Advertisement (RA)** attack. | ICMPv6 | An attacker sends out malicious Router Advertisement messages, pretending to be the legitimate router, and injects bad DNS or gateway information into neighboring hosts. |
| **Q106** | What is the purpose of the **SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)? | Transport | A transport layer protocol designed to combine the **reliability of TCP** with the **messaging features of UDP**, used primarily in telephony/telecommunications (SS7) signaling. |
| **Q107** | How can a hacker utilize **TFTP** (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) for reconnaissance? | Application | TFTP is often used for transferring configuration files and firmware. If found running and unsecured, an attacker can download configuration files containing passwords or network maps. |
| **Q108** | What is the default port for **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and what is the secure version? | Application | Default port is **389**. The secure version is **LDAPS** (LDAP over SSL/TLS), which uses port **636**. |
| **Q109** | What is **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning**? | Name Resolution | Attacks (often using Responder tool) that exploit the weak or non-existent authentication in Local Link Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) to answer name resolution requests for non-existent resources with the attacker’s address, capturing credentials. |
| **Q110** | In WPA2, what is the difference between **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)** and **Enterprise (802.1X)** mode? | 802.11 | **PSK** uses a single shared password for all users. **Enterprise** uses **802.1X** and a RADIUS server, giving each user a unique credential and session key, making it far more secure. |
| **Q111** | What is a **Probe Request** in 802.11, and how is it used in reconnaissance? | 802.11 | A frame sent by a wireless client searching for a known network. An attacker can sniff these requests to learn the **SSIDs** (network names) the client has connected to in the past. |
| **Q112** | What is the main defense against **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning**? | Security | Disabling LLMNR/NBT-NS if not needed, or, ideally, migrating to a secure, authoritative DNS solution and enforcing **NTLMv2** authentication. |
| **Q113** | What is the significance of the **EtherType** field in an Ethernet frame? | Layer 2 | A two-octet field that indicates which **protocol** is encapsulated in the payload of the Ethernet frame (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4, 0x86DD for IPv6, 0x0806 for ARP). |
| **Q114** | How can an attacker use **Port Mirroring/SPAN**? | Layer 2 | An attacker gains physical or logical access to a network switch and configures a port to receive a **copy of all traffic** (or selected traffic) passing through other switch ports for passive sniffing. |
| **Q115** | What is **GRE Keying**, and why is it used? | GRE | The use of a **Key field** in the GRE header to ensure that only packets with a valid, matching key are accepted at the tunnel endpoint, adding a small layer of security against injection attacks. |
| **Q116** | What is the risk of using default or unencrypted **SSH Keys**? | SSH | If the private key is not protected by a strong passphrase or is discovered, an attacker can gain **passwordless remote access** to the host, bypassing standard authentication checks. |
| **Q117** | How can a hacker leverage **ICMP Time Exceeded** messages on a large-scale network? | ICMP | By analyzing the source IP of these messages, they can **map out the internal network topology** and identify the IP addresses of internal routers and security devices (traceroute in reverse). |
| **Q118** | What is the role of the **ACK Storm** in a TCP DoS attack? | TCP | When a firewall or connection is misconfigured, an attacker can send numerous forged packets, causing the target to generate a vast number of ACKs in response, overwhelming the network bandwidth. |
| **Q119** | Name one security risk associated with **UPnP** (Universal Plug and Play). | Application/Security | UPnP allows devices to open ports on a router automatically. If a compromised device uses UPnP, it can open a firewall hole, allowing external access to the internal network. |
| **Q120** | What is the purpose of **Syslog** (System Logging Protocol), and why is it a crucial resource for forensics? | Application | Syslog standardizes the creation and forwarding of log messages. It is crucial because it provides a **centralized, tamper-resistant record** of security events, failures, and system activity for incident response. |
| **Q121** | What is the purpose of **SIP** (Session Initiation Protocol) in VoIP? | Application | SIP is a **signaling protocol** used to establish, modify, and terminate two-party or multi-party multimedia sessions (like voice or video calls) over an IP network. |
| **Q122** | What is **RTP** (Real-time Transport Protocol)? | Application | RTP is used to **carry the actual voice/media data** (the stream) during a VoIP call, operating over UDP for speed. It handles sequencing, timing, and jitter compensation. |
| **Q123** | Describe a **SIP Flooding Attack**. | SIP | A DoS attack where the attacker rapidly sends a high volume of **SIP INVITE** or **SIP REGISTER** messages to a target VoIP server (PBX or proxy), exhausting its resources and preventing legitimate calls. |
| **Q124** | What is the security implication of an unencrypted **RTP stream**? | RTP | The voice data is transmitted in clear text. An attacker who can sniff the network traffic can easily capture, play back, and listen to the entire conversation using tools like Wireshark. |
| **Q125** | What is the difference between **IKEv1** and **IKEv2** in IPsec? | IPsec | **IKEv2** offers simplicity, enhanced robustness (e.g., better NAT traversal), and superior support for mobility and **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** compared to the older IKEv1. |
| **Q126** | What is the function of **PPPoE** (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet)? | Encapsulation | A protocol used mainly by ISPs to **encapsulate PPP frames over Ethernet networks** to provide authentication and manage multiple subscribers over a single network connection. |
| **Q127** | How can a hacker utilize **Port Scanners** that use the **IP Protocol Field**? | IP | Instead of checking TCP/UDP ports, they iterate through the **Protocol Number field** (e.g., 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP, 1 for ICMP) to discover which non-standard protocols (like GRE, EIGRP, or SCTP) are allowed by a firewall. |
| **Q128** | What is the primary function of **RSVP** (Resource Reservation Protocol)? | QoS | A signaling protocol designed to reserve network resources (bandwidth) for Quality of Service (QoS) requests, particularly for applications like VoIP and video. |
| **Q129** | How can an attacker abuse **QoS** protocols like RSVP? | QoS | By making excessive, malicious resource reservation requests, an attacker can consume all available bandwidth guarantees, leading to a **Denial of Service** for legitimate users who require high-quality service. |
| **Q130** | What is **L2TP** (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)? | Tunneling | A tunneling protocol often used in VPNs that **encapsulates Layer 2 frames (like PPP) within Layer 3 packets (like UDP)**. It typically requires **IPsec** to provide encryption and security. |
| **Q131** | What is the role of the **MTU** (Maximum Transmission Unit) in IP security? | IP | MTU is the largest packet size a link can carry. An attacker can manipulate this (using **fragmentation**) to send packets too large for security devices to properly reassemble or inspect, enabling **firewall bypass**. |
| **Q132** | Explain **IP Spoofing**. | IP | An attacker forges the **Source IP Address** in an IP packet's header to impersonate another legitimate host, often used in DoS attacks (like SYN floods) or to bypass simple, source-based access controls. |
| **Q133** | What is **EIGRP** (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)? | Routing | A Cisco proprietary **hybrid** routing protocol (both Distance Vector and Link-State characteristics) that is now open standard. An attacker targets its authentication to inject false routes. |
| **Q134** | What is a **Piggyback Acknowledgement** in TCP? | TCP | A technique where a segment that is carrying **data** also carries the **ACK** for previously received data, increasing efficiency by combining two control messages into one data segment. |
| **Q135** | What is **CoS** (Class of Service) and how is it used in Layer 2? | Layer 2/QoS | An 802.1p field in the VLAN tag used by Layer 2 switches to classify and prioritize frames. An attacker might manipulate this value to elevate their own traffic priority. |
| **Q136** | What is the security drawback of **IPv4 Multicast**? | IP | Multicast traffic is typically **not filtered** by routers/firewalls as carefully as unicast traffic, making it a vector for delivering malicious payloads or performing covert command and control. |
| **Q137** | What is the main defense against **SIP Flooding**? | SIP/Security | Implementing **SIP rate limiting** and using an **SBC (Session Border Controller)** to filter, validate, and authenticate SIP messages before they reach the internal IP-PBX. |
| **Q138** | How is **QoS Marking** used in reconnaissance? | QoS | An attacker can analyze how network devices mark their traffic (e.g., DSCP values in the IP header) to understand the **network's internal policies** and how traffic is prioritized and filtered. |
| **Q139** | What is **Hairpinning** (or NAT Loopback)? | NAT | A scenario where an external request returns to the internal network. This often reveals different behavior than direct internal access, which can be leveraged by attackers for information gathering. |
| **Q140** | Explain **Tunnel Mode** vs. **Transport Mode** in IPsec. | IPsec | **Transport Mode** encrypts only the **payload** (data) of the IP packet. **Tunnel Mode** encrypts the **entire original IP packet** (header + payload) and encapsulates it within a new IP packet. (Tunnel Mode is used for VPNs). |
| **Q141** | What is a **Wormhole Attack** in a mesh or ad-hoc wireless network? | 802.11 | Two colluding malicious nodes tunnel packets through a low-latency link, convincing other nodes that the distance between the two ends of the tunnel is very short, disrupting routing paths. |
| **Q142** | How can a hacker use **NetFlow/IPFIX** information? | Management | Although typically used for monitoring, if NetFlow data (which details conversation statistics: source, destination, volume, time) is captured, it provides highly detailed **reconnaissance** on internal application usage and traffic patterns. |
| **Q143** | What is the **Don't Fragment (DF) Bit** in the IP header, and why is it important for path discovery? | IP | When set, it tells routers **not to fragment** the packet. If the packet hits a link with a smaller MTU, it will be dropped, and the router will typically send a **Destination Unreachable** message back (used for PMTUD). |
| **Q144** | Describe the vulnerability exploited by a **Teardrop Attack**. | IP | An attack that exploits the way some operating systems handle **fragmented IP packets** by sending fragments with overlapping or non-sequential offset fields, causing the target's system to crash upon reassembly. |
| **Q145** | What is the role of **H.323** in VoIP, and why is it less common than SIP? | Application | H.323 is an older, more complex, and **binary** signaling protocol for VoIP. It is less common because SIP is **text-based**, easier to implement, and more flexible for integration with web technologies. |
| **Q146** | What is the purpose of **NAT Traversal** (STUN/TURN/ICE) in VoIP/SIP? | NAT/SIP | These protocols help SIP endpoints (VoIP phones) located behind NAT firewalls **discover their public IP address and port** and establish direct media streams (RTP) with each other. |
| **Q147** | What is the risk of enabling **Universal Peer-to-Peer** features in protocols like SIP? | SIP | It can expose internal devices to the public internet by attempting to bypass NAT/firewalls, increasing the attack surface. |
| **Q148** | Why is **MD5** hashing considered weak for securing routing protocols (e.g., BGP)? | Routing/Security | MD5 is susceptible to **collision attacks** and is computationally fast, making it easy for an attacker to craft a forged routing update that generates the same MD5 checksum, thereby spoofing a trusted peer. |
| **Q149** | What is **Mobile IP** and what is the security challenge associated with it? | IP | Allows a mobile node to maintain its permanent IP address while moving between different networks. The challenge is ensuring the **security and integrity of the tunneling** between the Home Agent and Foreign Agent. |
| **Q150** | What is the role of the **TOS (Type of Service)** field in the IP header (now DSCP)? | IP/QoS | Used to specify the desired **Quality of Service (QoS)** for the packet, allowing intermediate routers to prioritize or classify the traffic, which is critical knowledge for an attacker attempting to blend in or deny service. |
