# Bug Bounty Notes

    - So you don't get lost in your own recon. Ever found a juicy endpoint..., Then forgot where you saved it?
    Yeah, we all did.

    - That is why "note-taking" is a hidden weapon in bug bounty.

    - And no, not just random Notepad files. Let me show you how to keep your notes clean, sharp, and useful.

## 0. Recon

    - Surface area of a Company, Endpoints, Legacy systems, Forgotten Features, third-Party Integrations

## 1. Use One Central Tool

    - Choose tools like:
        - Obsidian
        - Notion
        - CherryTree
        - HackNote
        - Markdown folders with VSCode
    - Do not switch daily. Stick to one.

## 2. Structure Your Notes Like This:

    - Simple folders, easy access.
        - Recon/
        - Endpoints/
        - Payloads/
        - Burp Logs/
        - Tools/
        - Vulnerabilities/
        - Bug Reports/
        - Writeups/

## 3. Save With Context

    - Do not just paste a URL. Write:
        - What tool found it
        - When
        - Why it looks interesting
        - What you tried already
    - Future-you will thank you.

## 4. Create a Cheatsheet Section

    - Store useful one-liners, headers, payloads, etc.
    - This saves time in real tests.

## 5. Sync Your Notes with Cloud

    - GDrive, GitHub Private Repo, or Obsidian Sync.
    - Never lose your findings.

## 6. Weekly Review

    - Spend 10 mins every Sunday.
    - Clean old notes, highlight new ideas, set next targets.

### Notes

    - Organized notes = faster results + fewer repeats.
    - Even the best recon is useless if you forget it.

    - Start small. Build your system.
    - This is how you level up silently.
