# Unrestricted Resource Consumption

## Full-Coverage, No-Code Methodology

### üåê RECONNAISSANCE & CAPABILITY MAPPING

  - Map all endpoints and operations requiring backend resources: file uploads/downloads, data export, image/video processing, notifications, search, payment, analytics, batch actions.[1]
  - Document resource-intensive flows: profile picture uploads, large file sharing, transaction processing, external integrations (SMS, email, cloud storage).
  - Catalog all entry points for paginated/batch data requests (pagination, bulk update, batch inserts, multi-upload).
  - Identify client-controlled parameters affecting resource usage: size, length, record count, concurrency, batch size.
  - Review backend integrations/payments (third-party APIs) charged per request or usage.
  - Analyze platform for limits on file size, number of requests, allowed records or data elements.

### üîç ATTACK VECTORS & RESOURCE ABUSE

  - Fuzz endpoints with maximum, minimum, and invalid resource-consuming parameters (huge files, long strings, large array/object counts, deep nested objects).[1]
  - Perform batch operations with excessive items‚Äîexceed normal bulk operation sizes to stress the backend.
  - Replay rapid, concurrent API calls to simulate DoS and resource exhaustion (network, memory, CPU).
  - Abuse third-party integrations by repeatedly triggering cost-inducing operations (e.g., SMS/email/billing API calls with valid and fake data).
  - Attempt large downloads/uploads to verify bandwidth and storage management.
  - Chain API calls with automated tools/scripts to simulate high traffic or attack scenarios.
  - Explore GraphQL/REST mutations for complex actions (multiple thumbnail generations, mass updates/deletes).
  - Enumerate possible bypasses for rate limiting, file upload restrictions, request quotas (multiple accounts, rotating tokens/IPs).
  - Test edge cases in execution time, file descriptor limits, concurrent resource usage.

### üíæ BUSINESS LOGIC ABUSE & COST INFLATION

  - Simulate scenarios where legitimate actions (password reset, photo uploads, report exports) are abused via automation.
  - Exploit lack of pagination or record count restriction in bulk data exports/imports.
  - Abuse expensive API endpoints from a single or multiple clients‚Äîtarget SMS, email, phone calls, biometrics, or cloud resource actions.[1]
  - Monitor platform/resource costs and performance metrics during mass or automated operations.
  - Attempt to bypass business process or billing alerts using crafted payloads or bulk operations.

### üß† ADVANCED ENUMERATION & DEFENSE BYPASS

  - Test multi-tenancy and cross-account boundaries for aggregate resource consumption vulnerabilities.
  - Combine resource-intensive API calls with authentication/session manipulation (parallel sessions, token-based spam).
  - Inspect caching/CDN layers‚Äîverify large resource requests do not bypass cache or add direct provider costs.
  - Attempt indirect resource exhaustion (e.g., task delays, pending jobs, unthrottled notifications).
  - Analyze timeouts, process limits, exception handling, and retry logic for DoS, process forks, or uncontrolled memory/CPU consumption.

### üéØ AUTOMATION & MONITORING

  - Deploy automated resource abuse scripts simulating real and attack traffic patterns.
  - Integrate with backend or cloud metrics/monitoring (CPU, RAM, IO, bandwidth, spending logs).
  - Track and visualize the impact of unrestricted resource consumption for security reporting.
  - Test proper alerting/billing for increased costs or failed resource limits.

### üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE VALIDATION & PREVENTION TESTS

  - Validate all size, count, and concurrency limits‚Äîfile sizes, upload/download, request batch sizes, record counts, timeout windows.[1]
  - Check implementation of rate limiting, quotas, and operation frequency controls.
  - Confirm robust validation for query string/body parameters controlling resource allocations and output volume.
  - Test external integrations for cost and usage alerting (billing limits, provider quotas).
  - Ensure server-side checks are enforced under all conditions (parallel requests, multiple endpoints, alternate flows).
  - Check for effective billing, resource monitoring, and cost control (alerts, thresholds, review mechanisms).
  - Confirm applications degrade gracefully‚Äîno partial, inconsistent, or prolonged resource allocation under abuse.

### üèÅ BUSINESS IMPACT & FINAL REPORTING

  - Map discovered risks to real-world impact: DoS, increased infrastructure costs, failed services, third-party billing surges.[1]
  - Document clear reproduction paths and attack chains.
  - Prioritize defense for endpoints with highest cost or operational impact.
  - Validate fixes and mitigation with load, fuzzing, and abuse retesting.
