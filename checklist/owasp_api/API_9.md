# Improper Inventory Management

## Full-Coverage, Methodology-First ‚Äî No Code Required

### üåê STACK, ENVIRONMENT & ENDPOINT MAPPING

  - Enumerate all API hosts, endpoints, environments (production, staging, development, beta, legacy)‚Äîtrack subdomains, alternate IPs, cloud zones, and network segments.[1]
  - Map API versions (v1, v2, /beta, /test), document deployment footprints, and identify endpoints exposed in each environment.
  - Review published and internal API documentation‚Äînote blind spots, missing endpoints, or outdated information.
  - Analyze network policies and external access controls per environment and version.
  - Identify orphaned, legacy, or deprecated APIs still accessible or running but not maintained.
  - Discover APIs via passive methods (Google dorks, DNS enumeration, endpoint scanning tools, internet search engines for connected services).

### üîç ENDPOINT DISCOVERY & DATA FLOW AUDIT

  - Enumerate all endpoint paths, parameters, supported workflows, error messages, and integration callbacks.
  - Test old/legacy endpoints for weakened security‚Äîlack of rate-limiting, authentication/authorization gaps, missing validation or logging.[1]
  - Look for endpoints with excessive access rights, permissions, or business privilege (admin, multi-tenant, mass-export).
  - Audit data flow between internal and external APIs‚Äîexamine what sensitive data is shared, with whom, and under which business justifications.
  - Map third-party, partner, and integration APIs. Test for over-exposure or excessive permissions on personal, privileged, or relational data.
  - Identify endpoints using production databases in non-production environments.

### üíæ AUTOMATION, REDUNDANCY & SYSTEM GAPS

  - Use automated tools to scan, enumerate, and monitor hosts/endpoints regularly‚Äîinclude subdomain discovery, port scanning, and public asset tracker integration.
  - Probe for shadow APIs, unregistered services, outdated workflow endpoints, and undocumented features revealed by client/mobile code or error responses.
  - Review inventory management traceability: is there a CI/CD asset registry, automated documentation generation, or centralized inventory dashboard?
  - Test inventory management process‚Äîautomation for updating documentation and assets after each release or change.
  - Audit data sensitivity and access logging for orphaned/deprecated endpoints‚Äîdo logs exist, are they monitored, and who has visibility?

### üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE VALIDATION & POLICY TESTS

  - Verify strict access controls and security protections across all API instances, not just production.[1]
  - Confirm security patches and updates are applied to ALL exposed API hosts.
  - Check for appropriate decommissioning and retirement processes‚Äîdeprecated endpoints should be sunset according to policy.
  - Ensure all API data flows, especially sensitive or privileged, have full justification, access control review, and periodic audit.
  - Test and enforce least-privilege principle in both endpoint exposure and data flow permissions.
  - Validate that production data is never used in non-production environments, or gets equal protection if unavoidable.
  - Review onboarding and offboarding of endpoints, third-party integrations, and asset management process.
  - Monitor exposed APIs for asset drift, shadow endpoints, and inventory inaccuracies.

### üèÅ BUSINESS IMPACT & REPORTING

  - Map identified blind spots and untracked endpoints to real-world business risk‚Äîdata leaks, privileged access, admin takeover, server exploits, compliance loss.[1]
  - Document exploit steps, impact chains, and remediation priorities.
  - Recommend continuous inventory management, automated service discovery, and CI/CD-powered documentation to eliminate asset blind spots.
  - Validate fixes and asset management improvements; retest periodically for drift, redundancy, and exposure.
