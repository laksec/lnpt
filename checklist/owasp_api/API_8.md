# Security Misconfiguration

## End-to-End Methodology ‚Äî No Code Required

### üåê RECONNAISSANCE & STACK ENUMERATION

  - Enumerate all API components: backend servers, proxies, gateways, orchestration layers, and cloud integrations.[1]
  - Map exposed services (HTTP, admin panels, logging utilities, cache servers, message brokers, local endpoints).
  - Analyze API endpoint documentation, cloud provider consoles, deployment manifests (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform).
  - Identify software and dependency versions; monitor patch and update status for each stack component.
  - Catalog supported HTTP verbs, data formats, allowed content types, protocol requirements (TLS, plaintext, websocket, etc.).
  - Review access controls, firewall rules, load balancer routing, and orchestration (API keys, CORS domains, cache servers).

### üîç DEEP MISCONFIGURATION PROBING

  - Probe all endpoints with unnecessary HTTP verbs (HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE); check for unprotected/unintended actions.[1]
  - Attempt API requests with legacy/unsupported data formats (XML, YAML, SOAP, raw files).
  - Send malformed or oversized payloads‚Äîtest for unhandled exceptions, excessive resource allocation, or stack overflows.
  - Test for missing or permissive CORS headers; probe with browser-based attacks to confirm cross-origin exposure.
  - Analyze response headers for absent or weak security directives: missing `Cache-Control`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.
  - Attempt requests over HTTP and observe if APIs accept or redirect plaintext traffic; check for internal/external TLS gaps.
  - Submit crafted input meant to be written to logs‚Äîtest for injection, path traversal, code/log deserialization exploits (e.g., JNDI, RCE in logging utilities).[1]
  - Review error messages‚Äîlook for stack traces, configuration leaks, or sensitive system/environment details.
  - Probe public file and directory exposure: unprotected config files, open cloud buckets, accessible logs, secrets, or credentials.

### üíæ AUTOMATION, EDGE CASES & ADVANCED BYPASS

  - Scan with automated misconfiguration tools or scripts, including vulnerability scanners, open API enumerators, and environment auditing frameworks.
  - Test for outdated/legacy endpoints; probe with documentation, source control, and archive searches.
  - Enumerate permissions on cloud resources (buckets, queues, secrets)‚Äîare objects world-readable/writable, or mis-scoped to public users?
  - Attempt replay attacks and request smuggling via load balancer or proxy‚Äîdetect inconsistencies in request interpretation between HTTP chain elements.
  - Probe for misconfigured cache, rate limits, or scaling‚Äîtest for server-side desync issues and cross-tenant leakage.
  - Mix malformed headers, custom content types, or unsupported encodings for parsing confusion.

### üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE VALIDATION & REMEDIATION TESTS

  - Validate end-to-end security hardening: patching, version upgrades, configuration enforcement (test repeatability and automation).[1]
  - Confirm strict access control: APIs only accessible to intended roles, groups, networks, and service accounts.
  - Ensure only necessary features/API endpoints are exposed‚Äîdisable legacy, development, or unused functions.
  - Enforce TLS across all communication channels, internal and public; document deprecation of HTTP access.
  - Test for uniform request processing across all servers; no protocol or interpretation gaps in reverse/proxy/server chain.
  - Apply restrictive CORS and security headers for web-facing APIs.
  - Restrict incoming payloads to business-required formats and content types.
  - Audit error handling and logging practices‚Äînever expose stack traces, config details, or environmental metadata externally.
  - Automate configuration reviews and monitoring in CI/CD and runtime environments for drift and unauthorized changes.

### üèÅ BUSINESS IMPACT & REPORTING

  - Map discovered misconfigurations to data exposure, privilege escalation, server compromise, or persistent system vulnerabilities.[1]
  - Document reproduction steps and exploit chains.
  - Summarize systemic risks and recommended remediation actions.
  - Validate fixes, include periodic configuration review automation, and help teams build repeatable hardening routines.
