# Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

## End-to-End, Methodology-First‚ÄîNo Code Needed

### üåê RECONNAISSANCE & SENSITIVE FLOW MAPPING

  - Map every API endpoint exposing critical business actions: purchases, booking/reservations, promotions, posting/commenting, credits/rewards, transactions, account creation, referral programs, high-value workflows.[1]
  - Document business processes‚Äîstock management, loyalty rewards, order fulfillment, ticketing, content publishing, and economic/privilege flows.
  - Identify APIs linked to limited resources, high-demand products, discounts, credits, or promotional actions.
  - Analyze business logic for economic impact: inventory depletion, discounts/price drops, spam/abuse, reward inflation, denial of legitimate access.
  - Gather client workflows (web/mobile/automation/backend) for all sensitive flows‚Äîpurchase, book, refer, post, reserve, or claim functions.
  - Inspect documentation, source code, and client-side logic for endpoint discovery and consumption patterns.

### üîç ABUSE VECTORS & AUTOMATION TESTING

  - Attempt abusive access: bulk/batch purchases, mass reservations, spam comment/posting, referral/loyalty exploitation, excessive promo code redemption.[1]
  - Automate business flow access: script requests for buying, booking, posting, redeeming, or referring at high frequency and volume.
  - Use multiple accounts/IPs/devices to simulate distributed automation and bypass naive per-user limits.
  - Test critical workflows under different roles and permission models‚Äîare certain direct integrations (dev, B2B, admin) lacking proper protection?
  - Probe all critical business actions for absence of device profiling, rate limiting, or behavioral analysis.
  - Analyze sequential, chained, and batch operations‚Äîcan they bypass limits or gain compound advantage?
  - Explore indirect flows‚Äîactions with secondary business impact (e.g., canceling tickets, incentivizing reward abuse, triggering indirect price changes).

### üíæ BUSINESS LOGIC ABUSE & IMPACT SCENARIOS

  - Simulate scalping: purchase all limited/high-demand items before users can act.[1]
  - Perform reservation floods: book all slots/resources to block real users.
  - Exploit unlimited credits or rewards: automate referrals, exploit promo flows, abuse reward systems.
  - Spam creation: rapidly create comments, posts, tickets, or dependencies to saturate resources.
  - Drop or manipulate prices: abuse cancellation flows, mass reserve and cancel, trigger unintended economic shifts.
  - Monitor legitimate user experience in presence of attack‚Äîdetect denial, privilege loss, or forced price adjustment.

### üß† DEFENSE BYPASS & ANTI-AUTOMATION GAPS

  - Test absence of anti-bot, rate-limiting, and device verification (no CAPTCHA, fingerprinting, or behavioral checks).
  - Probe for weak/absent business logic to restrict non-human patterns (e.g., ultra-fast sequence actions, always same device/fingerprint).
  - Check for lack of IP, device, or behavioral restrictions; abuse Tor/proxy/cloud IPs.
  - See if the API directly exposed for automation or dev integrations (B2B, back-office) skips all human mitigation.
  - Audit logs for automated/bot activity, economic attacks, or abnormal promotion abuse.
  - Test advanced bypass by switching client types, user-agents, mimicking human actions or replaying browser events.

### üéØ AUTOMATION, SCANNING, & IMPACT VALIDATION

  - Use automation to orchestrate high-speed and distributed requests simulating attacker campaigns.
  - Integrate behavioral analysis tools to differentiate human vs. automated requests.
  - Monitor business KPIs under attack‚Äîstock, reservation, rewards, spam volume, legitimate access latency.
  - Collaborate with business stakeholders to assess economic, reputational, and operational risk.

### üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE VALIDATION & PROTECTION MECHANISMS

  - Confirm business logic drives technical enforcement‚Äîmark and protect all sensitive flows behind robust anti-automation and rate-limiting.[1]
  - Validate device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, human detection (CAPTCHA, biometrics, challenge-response) for sensitive actions.
  - Ensure no direct/unrestricted consumption of high-impact API endpoints by machine accounts or integrations.
  - Monitor and respond to automated business flow abuse‚Äîautomatic blocking, alerting, and adaptive risk throttling.
  - Test protection against distributed attacks: global rate limits, cross-account request correlation, anti-Tor/proxy restrictions.
  - Review access logs, KPIs, and incident response integration for business-critical flows.

### üèÅ BUSINESS IMPACT & POSTURE IMPROVEMENT

  - Map tested scenarios to real business harm: scalping, reservation denial, reward inflation, spam, price manipulation, denial of service to legit users.[1]
  - Write up clear exploit steps, detection methods, and proposed control improvements.
  - Help business/engineering teams plan "defense from business logic out"‚Äîalign technical controls with business priorities and threat models.
  - Include recurring assessment, continuous improvement, and KPI monitoring for sensitive flows.
